## Impacts

- Utah's climate is changing. 

- The state has warmed about two degrees (F) in the last century. 

- Throughout the western United States, heat waves are becoming more common, and snow is melting earlier in spring. 

- In the coming decades, the changing climate is likely to decrease the flow of water in Utahâ€™s rivers, increase the frequency and intensity of wildfires, and decrease the productivity of ranches and farms.

## State Adaptation / Mitigation Plans

- Utah has not developed a statewide adaptation plan. 

- Other resources from the Adaptation Clearinghouse, which have been developed by the state and localities to help communities prepare for climate change, such as:

- Sustainable Salt Lake - Plan 2015 (Salt Lake City, Utah)	March 18, 2013


- Climate Change and Public Health in Utah	Assessments	2012

- Climate Change in Park City, Utah: An Assessment of Climate, Snowpack, and Economic Impacts	Assessments	September 29, 2009
