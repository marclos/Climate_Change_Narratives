## Impacts

- In the coming decades, Georgia will become warmer, and the
state will probably experience more severe floods and drought.

- Recent trends suggest  more rain is falling in heavy downpours, and sea level
is rising about one inch every decade. 

- Higher water levels are eroding beaches, submerging low lands, and exacerbating coastal
flooding.

- The Georgia Climate Research RoadmapPlanning, May 23, 2018
- Resilient Atlanta - Actions to Build an Equitable Future	November 2, 2017
