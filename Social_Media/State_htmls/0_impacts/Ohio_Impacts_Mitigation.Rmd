## Impacts

- Ohioâ€™s climate is changing. 

- Most of the state has warmed by about one degree (F) in the last century. 

- Floods are becoming more frequent, and ice cover on the Great Lakes is forming later or melting sooner. 

- In the coming decades, the state will have more extremely hot days, which may harm public health in urban areas and corn harvests in rural areas.

## State Adaptation / Mitigation Plans

- Ohio has not developed a statewide adaptation plan. 

- Other resources from the Adaptation Clearinghouse, which have been developed by the state and localities to help communities prepare for climate change, such as:

- Columbus, Ohio Climate Adaptation Plan	December 18, 2018

- Cleveland, Ohio Climate Action Plan - 2018 Update	September 21, 2018

- 2018 Green Cincinnati Plan, Ohio: Leveraging Resilience to Become a Climate Haven	April 2018

- Green Cincinnati Plan	April 2018
