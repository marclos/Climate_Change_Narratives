## Impacts

- Indianaâ€™s climate is changing. 

- Most of the state has warmed about one degree (F) in the last century. 

- Floods are becoming more frequent, and ice cover on the Great Lakes is forming later or melting sooner. 

- In the coming decades, the state will have more extremely hot days, which may harm public health in urban areas and corn harvests in rural areas.

- Indiana has not developed a statewide adaptation plan. Other resources from the Adaptation Clearinghouse, which have been developed by the state and localities to help communities prepare for climate change, such as:
