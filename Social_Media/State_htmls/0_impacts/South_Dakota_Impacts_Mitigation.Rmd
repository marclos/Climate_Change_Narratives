## Impacts

- South Dakota's climate is changing. 

- In the past century, most of the state has warmed by one to two degrees (F). 

- Rainstorms are becoming more intense, and annual rainfall is increasing. 

- In the coming decades, summers are likely to become increasingly hot, which may amplify some risks to human health and decrease yields of some crops while lengthening the growing season for others.

## State Adaptation / Mitigation Plans

- South Dakota has not developed a statewide adaptation plan. 

- Other resources from the Adaptation Clearinghouse, which have been developed by the state and localities to help communities prepare for climate change, are highlighted below.
