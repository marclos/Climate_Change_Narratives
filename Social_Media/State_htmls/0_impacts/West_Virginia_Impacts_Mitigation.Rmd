## Impacts

- West Virginia's climate is changing. 

- Most of the state has warmed one-half to one degree (F) in the last century, and heavy rainstorms are becoming more frequent. 

- In the coming decades, a changing climate is likely to increase flooding, harm ecosystems, increase some health problems, and possibly threaten some recreational activities.
