## Impacts

- In the coming decades, changes in the earth's atmosphere are likely to alter several aspects of life in Guam. 

- The air and ocean are warming, sea level is rising, and the ocean is becoming more acidic. 

- These changes are likely to damage or destroy much of Guamâ€™s coral reef ecosystems, increase damages from flooding and typhoons, reduce the availability of fresh water during the dry season, and make air temperatures uncomfortably hot more often than they are today.
