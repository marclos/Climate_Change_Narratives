## Impacts

- Puerto Rico's climate is changing. 

- The Commonwealth has warmed by more than one degree (F) since the mid20th century, and the surrounding waters have warmed by nearly two degrees since 1901. 

- The sea is rising about an inch every 15 years, and heavy rainstorms are becoming more severe. 

- In the coming decades, rising temperatures are likely to increase storm damages, significantly harm coral reefs, and increase the frequency of unpleasantly hot days.
