## Impacts

- Missouri's climate is changing. 

- Most of the state has warmed one-half to one degree (F) in the last century, and floods are becoming more frequent. 

- In the coming decades, the state will have more extremely hot days, which may harm public health in urban areas and corn harvests in rural areas.
