\section{Evaluating Terrestrial Meteorological Data}

\subsection{Selected History of Climate Science}

Geologists have known the climate has been changing over the Earth's history. But what causes these changes has been a major research area for over 100 years. There are numerous drivers that contribute to changing climates -- including the arrangement of the continents on the planet, the distance to the sun, energy generated by the sun, volanic activity, and the composition of the Earth's atmosphere. 

It's the last one that we'll spend time because the Earth's temperature are changing pretty dramatically over the last 100 years and the cause is no mystery -- the human activity that has released carbon dioxide (CO$_2$) into the atmosphere. The two main sources of CO$_2$ is from land use change, e.g. deforestration, and the burning of fossil fuels, e.g. coal, oil, and natural gas. 

The first to propose the role of CO$_2$ on the Earth's atmosphere was a Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius, who figured out that CO$_2$ absorbs infarred light. Moreover, he deduced that the Earth's temperature was actually warmer than it might otherwise be if CO$_2$ was not part of the Earth's atmoshere. 

\subsection{Why Look at Individual Stations?}

I don't think there is a single, perfect way to analyze and communicate climate change. But the beauty of the network of stations in the USA and around the world is that these stations record weather as expecienced by local people. And while indiviudual stations may not represent the overall regional and global patterns well, this give us a mechanism to connect local experiences to regional or global processes. 

Of course, some may fixate on the local pattern and remain unconvinced of the larger context and for those folks, there may be better ways to communicated climate data. 

However, I would be remiss in failing to mention that some may fixate on local patterns and use these patterns to ignore or to dimiss the patterns in other regions. 

Finally, the impacts of climate change are highly specific to the region in question. Thus, once someone understands the impacts on climate change in their region, they my not be able to appreciate how differnet the climate impacts might affect other peoples, who maybe more vulneratble, around the globe. 

Thus, with these weaknessed in mind, I will pursue this project with an eye to address these other issues at later stages.

\subsection{Approach}

\subsubsection{NOAA Data Records}

The US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) maintains several sources of digital weather data from the USA and beyond. These data have been collected from stations around the country to support a wide range of human activities that include farming, aviation, shipping, and even armed conflict. 

At various times, these records have been used to evaluate long-term climate change with varying success. Without a doubt, these data are not perfect, but they remain that foundation of an effective adn professionally maintained environmental monitoring program that engenders integrity, even when facing budget cuts. 

I will use these data to select for a station with a long record for each state in the USA. Future projects might evaluate the record for stations around the world, but we will see about that.

\subsubsection{rNOAA Package and R}

R is an open source programming environment that has become one of the most popular tools for statiticians and data scientists. Capitalizing on the open source framework, a wide range of libraries or packages have been developed to faciliate data processing, analysis, and graphical displays. On such package is rNOAA developed to collect and display climate records stored on NOAA servers.

Using the package requires the use of a key. To maintain the integrity of the key, it's best to avoid posting the key in a public repository and to encryp the key to ensure it's not abused. 

\subsection{Selecting Weather Records by State}

There are numerous ways to analyze temperature records, where stations can be analyzed individually or records could be sampled and analyzed in spatially in grids. Each of these are valid approaches depending on the question to be addressed. 

In this case the question is ``Based on the longest state meterological record, is there a temperature trend?"

\subsubsection{Identify List of State IDs (FIPS)}

Using the rNOAA library in R, we can queary NOAA's database to identify station codes (FIPS) by state. With the states and some territories, there are 55 FIPS for US weather stations. 

rNOAA has a simple function to list for each of the states and the weather stations in each. I use ncdc\_locs() functions to select each state and ncdc\_station() to obtain the station ids with the longest records.

{\ttfamily\noindent\color{warningcolor}{\#\# Warning: Error: (429) - This token has reached its temporary request limit of 10000 per day.}}\end{kframe}
\end{knitrout}

The function queries the NOAA website and retrieves state codes, ``FIPS:XX''. Each state has a number of weather stations,\footnote{Project Idea: It would be nice to make a map of how concentrated the stations spatially.} some with a long record, some with a short record, and some with numerous interruptions. Our goal is to select a long record with few missing data. 

\subsubsection{Selection Stations}

With the state ids, we can evaluate the metadata for all the weather stations, which will work to get the longest records, using \texttt{ncdc\_stations()}. 

First, we subset the data for stations that actively collecting data. Then we'll sort to the active stations to find the one with the longest records. We will use these stations for our analysis.

The record selected has the following metadata associated with it, which will be used for nameing, labeling, and mapping.

\subsection{Functions to Collect and Clean GSOM}

To collect the data, I used a short function, but the download time is painfully slow because only 1 year can be obtained at a time. Might want to get a work around for this at some point.

\end{knitrout}

Functions to bin data into decades and scores. 



The function relies on two inputs, the station id and the measured parameter -- TMAX and TMIN in this case. After that, the data needs to be clean up quite a bit. 

Furthermore, I have converted units to Farenheit, which is not my favorite, but important for US consumption.
