## State Adaptation / Mitigation Plans

- On September 14, 2007, Governor Sarah Palin established the Alaska Climate Change Sub-Cabinet in order to advise the Office of the Governor in preparing and implementing a climate change strategy for the state (Administrative Order No. 238).
- An Adaptation Advisory Group was responsible for developing recommendations to address impacts of climate change in Alaska, and submitted its recommendations to the Sub-Cabinet on January 27, 2010. 
- The final 2010 plan, Alaskaâ€™s Climate Change Strategy: Addressing Impacts in Alaska (Strategy), recommends a variety of steps to address the current and anticipated impacts of climate change
