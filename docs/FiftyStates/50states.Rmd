# Introduction

## CO$_2$ Emissions and Climate Change

Human activities are driving climate change. While some debate about the severity and relative contribution of human activities, the evidence that humans are driving global warming is extremely compelling and is directly linked to CO$_2$ emmissions. Moreover, the planet's CO$_2$ emissions continue to increase, which means the warming will continue unless we can otherwise reduce the drivers of warming.

While the USA emits about 14% of the globes total CO$_2$ emissions, the second most important emitter, few in the US appreciate the uneven nature of climate change in terms of temperature.

## Weather Records and Climate Trends

Thankfully, the US has a robust network of weather stations and we can use this to evaluate how climate change might be impacting local weather patterns. Moreover, by looking at specific stations in the context of regional patterns, we can begin to see how various processes produce uneven and counter intuitive climate responses.

<script>if (window.addEventListener){ window.addEventListener("message", function(event) { if(event.data.length >= 22) { if( event.data.substr(0, 22) == "__MM-LOCATION.REDIRECT") location = event.data.substr(22); } }, false); } else if (window.attachEvent){ window.attachEvent("message", function(event) { if( event.data.length >= 22) { if ( event.data.substr(0, 22) == "__MM-LOCATION.REDIRECT") location = event.data.substr(22); } }, false); } </script>

## A Word of Warning

There are more ways to analyze climate patterns than there are people in the world. As a pastor once said to me, "we don't base our theology on one verse in the Bible", so we don't base our understanding of climate change on one dataset or analysis approach. 

Thus, while our individual weather stations provide indepedent sources of data that are combine to help us understand climate change, individual stations may or may not be consistent with the global pattern or expectation. For example in some regions, the signal (evidence) for climate change might be ambiguous and in other regions it might be easily detected. Learning to zoom in and telescope out is an important skill promoted by this project.

# Fifty+ States Project

We ofen hear about the globe's rising temperatures without learning much about how weather records in our own region might be contriubuting to these climate change patterns. 

In most cases, a station in a state supports the overall global pattern, but in some we see patterns that are ambiguous or even contractory. For this project, we analyze the records for a weather station in each state. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, results='hide'}
file = "Weather_Station_Records_and_Climate_Change.pdf"

sourcePath <- "../../Social_Media"
destinationPath <- "State_htmls"

file.copy(file.path(sourcePath, file), destinationPath, overwrite = TRUE)

sourcePath <- "../../Social_Media/State_htmls"
destinationPath <- "State_htmls"
dataFiles <- dir(sourcePath, "*.html", ignore.case = TRUE, all.files = TRUE)
file.copy(file.path(sourcePath, dataFiles), destinationPath, overwrite = FALSE)

home = "/home/CAMPUS/mwl04747/github/Climate_Change_Narratives/"
dbase = read.csv(paste0(home, "Social_Media/State_htmls/dbase.csv"))

```

## Approach

For this project, I downloaded the longest and most complete record for each state and developed a standard set of analysis procedures and share them below. 

I have also been working to create short videos that will be shared on various forms of social media. 

For additional description of the project methods and R code, see ([Weather Station Records and Communicating
Climate Change](https://github.com/marclos/Climate_Change_Narratives/raw/master/docs/Social_Media/State_htmls/Weather_Station_Records_and_Climate_Change.pdf))
 

## Basics in Analyzing Data

### Correlation and Causation

One of the most important parts of science is critical thinking, which begins with trying to root out logical falacies. One that comes up alot is the falacy that ``correlation is causation''. In our case, many of the analysis included here are changes over time. Time in and of itself isn't the cause of temperature or precipitation changes. Thus, we need to keep in mind, climate changes are due to complex dynanmics in the Earth System, which include natural and anthropocentric drivers. 

### Statistical Considerations

In many cases, I will report the probability associated with correlations. However, these statistics obscure one of the hardest concepts in statistics: we test the null hypothesis, which might be "no change". Thus, if the chances are low (< 5% change or 0.05 as a probability), we reject the null hypothesis and accept the altnernative, which in this case is "change". Frankly, statistics is a bit like walking in a door backwards. You stil get in, but the path is less straightforward.  

On this page, I create crude normal probability distributions for each 20 years of records using the mean and standard deviation to "visualize" the change. Most of the data do not meet the assumptions that the data are normally distributed, so we need to see these images as approximations and not a definitive analysis. 

### Animated Times Series and Predictionss

Sometimes it's a bit easier to see how these patterns develop over time and relative to what we think of as "pre-industrial" concentrations, which forms a base-line. 

```{r, prepare_img, eval=FALSE, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, results='hide'}
library(magick)

img <- image_graph(600, 340, res = 96)
for(i in min(maunaloa$decimal.date):max(maunaloa$decimal.date)){
par(las=1)
plot(average~decimal.date, data=maunaloa[maunaloa$decimal.date<=i,], type="l", ylab=expression(CO[2]*~ "(ppm)"), xlab="Year", ylim=c(280, max(maunaloa[maunaloa$decimal.date<=i,4])), 
main="Carbon Dioxide Concentration \n Mauna Loa, HI" )
abline(h=280, col="gray50", lty=2); text(1970, 285,  "Pre-Industrial Estimate", col="gray20")
muanaloa.loess = loess(average~decimal.date, data=maunaloa, span = 0.75, degree = 2, parametric = FALSE, drop.square = FALSE, normalize = TRUE)
maunaloa$loess <- predict(muanaloa.loess)
lines(loess~decimal.date, data=maunaloa, lwd=1.4, col="red")
}
dev.off()

#CO2_animation <- 
```

Although an animated figured can serve to show changes, it can also be distracting or hard to follow. For example, below I have a pretty straight forward image demonstrating the CO$_2$ changes in Mauna Loa. I think this works pretty well, but I suspect not everyone would agree.

```{r, co2animation, fig.margin = FALSE, fig.cap = "Observed CO~2~ concentrations (black) have been steadily increasing since we have begun measuring them in late 1950s, with a loess line (red). Note that the slope or the rate of change is also increasing.", fig.width=8, fig.height=5, cache=TRUE, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
image_animate(img, fps = 2, loop=5, optimize = TRUE)

#print(CO2_animation)
```

One take home lesson that is critical is that the patterns of the past may not lead to useful predictions into the future. A site that has not shown evidence of climate change in the past might stay the same or reach a tipping point where we might detect dramatic changes. We often rely on modeling the climate system to make predictions, which is well beyond my project here.

## New England

### Connecticut

```{r, label="Connecticut", fig.margin=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Station Map (ID: ", files$Station_ID, ")")}
# FIPS = 7
files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="Connecticut")), 1)
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))
```

[Connecticut](State_htmls/Connecticut.html)) has experienced a dramatic increase in tempteratures in the last few decades, between 2-4 degress if the patterns continue in this decade.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability. When red line is to the right of the blue line it suggests warming. NOTE: This is a crude analysis, see link for more information."}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$GSOM_dnorm.png))
```

### Delaware

```{r, label="Delaware", fig.margin=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Station Map (ID: ", files$Station_ID, ")")}
## ID = 8
files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="Delaware")), 1)
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))
```

Similar to Connecticut, [Delaware](State_htmls/Delaware.html)'s record suggest an dramatic increase in minimum temperatures in the last couple of decades, however, the maximum temperatures do not seem to show any obvious pattern of change. Thus, we need to look in more detail into the regional context to better understand this pattern. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability. When red line is to the right of the blue line it suggests warming. NOTE: This is a crude analysis, see link for more information."}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$GSOM_dnorm.png))
```

### Maine

```{r, label="Maine", fig.margin=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Station Map (ID: ", files$Station_ID, ")")}
files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="Maine")), 1)
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))

```

[Maine (2022)](State_htmls/Maine.html) has experienced dramatically warmer minumum and maximum temperatures in the last few decades. As one of the most northern states, we should note that climate models suggest that the higher latitude (i.e.the poles) will experience the greatest temperature changes.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability. When red line is to the right of the blue line it suggests warming. NOTE: This is a crude analysis, see link for more information."}
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$GSOM_dnorm.png))

```

### Massachusetts

```{r, label="Massachusetts", fig.margin=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Station Map (ID: ", files$Station_ID, ")")}
files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="Massachusetts")), 1)
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))

```

[Massachusetts (2022)](State_htmls/Massachusetts.html)'s record seems unambiguous, the temperatures have been warming dramatically. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability. When red line is to the right of the blue line it suggests warming. NOTE: This is a crude analysis, see link for more information."}

### New Hampshire

```{r, fig.margin=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Station Map (ID: ", files$Station_ID, ")")}
files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="New Hampshire")), 1)
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))

```

[New Hampshire (2022)](State_htmls/New Hampshire.html)'s might be the most pronounced in New England the temperature increases with as much as 5 degrees. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability. When red line is to the right of the blue line it suggests warming. NOTE: This is a crude analysis, see link for more information."}

files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="Rhode Island")), 1)
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))

```

[Rhode Island (2022)](State_htmls/Rhode Island.html)'s record... TBD

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability.

### Vermont

```{r, label="Vermont", fig.margin=TRUE, echo=FALSE, fig.cap=paste0("Station Map (ID: ", files$Station_ID, ")")}
files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="Vermont")), 1)

```

[Vermont (2022)](State_htmls/Vermont.html) will be TBD

# ID 18
files = tail(subset(dbase, subset=(State=="Kentucky")), 1)
knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))
```

[Kentucky](State_htmls/Kentucky.html)'s temperature changes do not seem to follow the expected warming trends. In fact, this figure suggests that some cooling has occurred. As noted throughout this text, we need to be sure 1) that the records is accurate and 2) to contextulize the changes at this location with others in the region. When we found consistent data between stations in a region, we might be in a better position to determine the overall patterns. Finally, we need to better understand the dynamics of weather in the region to see if we can have a more rubost understanding of climate change. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability.

```

Like other states west of the Appalachian Mountains, temperature changes in [Tennessee](State_htmls/Tennessee.html) are not obvious. While this crude analyze suggest that the temperature has slightly increased, we should look at other data to understand the processes influencing this region with more detail. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability.

knitr::include_graphics(paste0(files$png_private, files$Map))

```

[New York](State_htmls/New York.html)'s demonstrate a profound temperature change and with a further analysis we'll be able to appreciate the pattern better.

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="100%", fig.align = "center", fig.cap="Temperature and Precipitation distribution by 20-year periods. Overlap between curves demonstrates high variability.
