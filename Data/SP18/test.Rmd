## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
file="/home/CAMPUS/mmc02014/Climate_Change_Narratives/Data/SP18/choi_thurston county_data.csv"
import=read.csv(file)

str(import)
min(import$TMAX, na.rm = T)

as.Date(import$DATE)
as.character(import$DATE)
as.Date(import$DATE,"%m/%d/Y%")






```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
