%\subsection{Peer Review Blogs}

\subsubsection{Rational}

Reviewing a public product is a priviledge. And for the `reviewed' it's a gift. Thus, for each, the reviewer and reviewed, the value for the greater good is indisputable. 

As you review your collegeues work, try to keep in mind that you are promoting a better outcome and better science. In addition, pay attention to thinks that might have escaped your own process and that you find yourself saying, ``wow, that's a cool approach!''  Perhaps, you might adapt some of the things you read into your own writing!
