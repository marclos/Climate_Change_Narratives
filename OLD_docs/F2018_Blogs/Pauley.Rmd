Fuel Management in Varying Locations in California

Null Hypothesis 1: Prescribed burns and fuel management have no effect on amount of acres burned.
Null Hypothesis 2: The number of fires is correlated with the self-reported amount of prescribed burning and fuel management. 
Null Hypothesis 3: The amount of data on fuel management/ prescribed burning, in each counties strategic fire plan has no effect on the amount of acres burned. 

Definitions: 
“Fuel” - Buildup of underbrush, that is highly flammable, and allows wildfires to spread and increase in intensity. 
“Prescribed burns” - the controlled and monitored burning of certain areas to reduce fuel loads, and prevent susceptibility to larger wildfires. A tactic of fuel management.   

##	Introduction
Fuel management techniques, and prescribed burns, are being looked at as possible solutions to increasingly intense wildfires in many counties in California. Recent fires, such as the Mendocino Complex fire, or the Santa Barbara wildfire have set new records in duration, intensity, and destruction. These catastrophic fires have lead to calls for new plans of action beyond containment and suppression. This study began by looking at each county in California, and the number of fires, and acres burned, across each. We then looked at the California Strategic Wildfire Plans for seven counties, checking for a correlation between comprehensive fire plan (or lack thereof), and duration, strength, and intensity of wildfires in the region. We proposed that through fuel management techniques, and prescribed burns, a given county would be less likely to experience large fires. However, locations of various countries and the ecosystems they contain could greatly vary these numbers. In looking at California, Northern and Southern California have to be approached differently in terms of the applicability of things like prescribed burns and certain fuel management techniques. The length of the fire season, heat, and soil moisture all have to be considered in approaching fuel management solutions in California. This study hopes to show that through returning to natural fire regiments, utilizing prescribed burns and the clearing of fuel, we could help return to the ecology of the forest to resilience and resistance. We do though acknowledge that due to vegetation differences in different regions in California, fuel management practices should be location-specific and based off of extensive local research. 

## Analysis of R test:













```{r readcsv2datafram}
pauley.df <- read.csv("data/Fuel Management data - Pauley.csv")
```

What did we create?

```{r ToBeRemovedLater}
str(pauley.df)
```

Shoot, the variable are not numeric. Going to have to fix that! Need to remove the empty row... then we can run the code below and it "should" work... :-)


## Testing Hypothesis

Prescribed burns versus Acre Burned... actually, let's do acres burned as a function of prescribed... make sense?

```{r linearmodel}
# ugly names of variables, but it will work for now. If you feel like it, you can modify the csv file and make nice shore column names...

Hypoth1 <- lm(Total.Acres.Burned ~ Prescribed.Fire..acres., data=pauley.df)

```

Evaluate results:

## Graph 1: 
	We first analyzed how the acres of prescribed fire would affect total acres burned from wildfires. The graph shows that an increase in prescribed fires exponentially decreases the total acres burned from wildfires. This graph proves half of our first null hypothesis wrong. We had to remove an outlier from this graph–of 277,884 acres burned in Shasta County which was due to an abnormally large fire compared to the other fires we are analyzing. 
 
## Graph 2:
	Next we looked at how the acres of fuel management would affect total acres burned from wildfires. The right half shows that an increase in prescribed fires rapidly decreases the total acres burned from wildfires. The leftmost point on the graph is inconsistent with the data because Santa Barbara county had no record of acres of fuel management on their strategic wildfire plan. It is likely not true that they practiced no fuel management within the year. 
 
## Graph 3:
	In this graph we looked at how the acres of fuel management would affect the number of fires burned from wildfires (instead of acres). This graph showed no significant pattern. This is likely due to several other factors and a lack of counties that we analyzed. 

 
## Graph 4:
	In this graph we looked at how the acres of prescribed fire would affect the number of fires burned from wildfires. Contrary to our belief, this graph shows that an increase in acres of prescribed fires increases the number of wildfires. This graph doesn’t show however how big these fires are. For example, Riverside has the highest number of fires. But we noticed that all of Riverside’s fires were extremely small. It could be concluded that although fuel management may not decrease the number of fires, but the relative size of fires. It might be possible that with an increase of fuel management, fires will less likely grow rapidly. On the other hand, Nevada-Yuba county had by far the most acres of fuel management and only had 4 fires, disproving the trend of the graph. 

### Location Implications for Fuel Management

### Santa Barbara

Santa Barbara lies in a chaparral biome–with flat plains, rocky hills, mountain slopes, and some grasslands. The fact that Santa Barbara had little information or data on fuel management and prescribed fires likely has to do with the fact that certain fuel management techniques such as fuel removal is much more difficult in a chaparral landscape. Because there are few trees, “removing the underbrush” does not seem practical because most vegetation in the area is underbrush. Some people argue that fuel reduction and prescribed fire should not be used in chaparral-covered hillsides in California in the same way that fuel reduction is used in forests. 
Riverside and Los Angeles

On the other hand, Riverside County, also an urban area within a chaparral biome, had the largest amount of documented prescribed fire and fuel management acreage and the fewest acres burned from wildfire within the 7 counties we looked at. Santa Barbara had over 14x more acreage burned than Riverside, indicating that despite the ecological controversy, it may have been successful. Los Angeles, also a largely urban area documented no prescribed fire acres, but documented 4,712 acres of fuel management. There were in fact far more acres burned by wildfire in LA County compared to Riverside despite their close proximity. This may be due to prescribed fires in Riverside, and the lack there of in LA.

### Kern

Kern County is further east than the two previous counties. Within Kern County, there is the Mojave Desert, chaparral, and some conifer forests. The desert biome is particularly prone to fires caused by lightning. Because there is little vegetation in the eastern half, it is reasonable that Kern County didn’t have any documented acres of prescribed fire.








### Nevada-Yuba

This Northern county is composed of much different vegetation than what is often found in the south. Nevada-Yuba has grasslands, oak woodlands, and conifer forests–which some scientists claim are biomes that can more effectively clear overgrown fuel in the underbrush than might be possible in chaparral biomes. Nevada-Yuba documented the most prescribed fire acres (6,841 acres) and the fourth most fuel management acres (3,721 acres) in the 7 counties we compared. Although Nevada-Yuba had the 3rd highest amount of acres burned within the 7 counties, it is possible that Nevada-Yuba allows the natural fires to occur and may not focus so heavily on suppression. 
Tulare 

Tulare County, located above Kern County, had a very small amount of prescribed fire acres and fuel management acres, at 292 and 176 respectively. Tulare has a very diverse vegetation with a small portion in the Mojave Desert, along with some chaparral, conifer and juniper forests. With the presence of juniper and chaparral, fuel management practices may be difficult due to the homogeneity in the height of the trees. People may be reluctant to invest resources into fuel management when prescribed burns or fuel removal might damage the natural ecosystem of the shorter shrubbery with little underbrush. Despite the lack of documented acreage of prescribed fire and fuel management, Tulare had the second smallest acreage of burns from wildfire. 

### Shasta 

Shasta County, located in the uppermost section of California, is mainly dominated with Conifer forests. Shasta was the outlier in our data with a strikingly large amount of total acres burned by wildfire at 277,884 acres–over 55 times more acreage than the next highest at 5,017 in Kern County. This figure is from the massive Carr Fire that occurred in August, that spanned across both Shasta and Trinity Counties. Despite this being an anomaly in the data, Shasta County had less than 1,400 combined acres of prescribed fires and fuel management. Because this county is largely dominated with conifer forests, there is no reason why fuel management practices were sparse. 



## Conclusion
Wildfires are bound to happen in California. Our original belief, that Southern California has used excessive suppression techniques, has now shifted after looking at the data in terms of location. Our original thought was that fire suppression was disrupting natural fire regimes. And while this very well may be true, we must separate many more factors out of the equation to validate this conclusion. This may be true in northern counties with large portions of conifer forests, but southern counties are limited in their ability to practice fuel management because of their vegetation makeup. The data presented in the R analysis shows to be inconclusive, however some anomalies in these graphs seem to explain these anomalies.

In the future, if this test were to be redone, scientists should compare data in counties in close proximity. The inconsistency in the cdf Strategic Fire Plans throughout counties shows that that fuel management practices are locally specific. I do believe however comparing these data would be made much easier if each county was accountable for updating data on fuel management techniques. A centralized website to find these data is a good way for researchers to understand what techniques are working and which aren’t. A centralized website also ensures that researchers are not accidentally double counting fires because he or she needed to reference multiple. 

 In looking again at the three null hypothesis, we can state with reasonable certainty that fuel management techniques and prescribed burning help to reduce total acreage burned. The total number of fires, in contrast, does not seem to have a correlation with total acreage burned. It may help, however, with reducing the duration, intensity, and heat of fires. 
 
California’s wildfire epidemic is highly involved with location based policies. Understanding how and why fuel management should be utilized will help California move toward restoration of natural fire regimes as well as better safety for California residents.
